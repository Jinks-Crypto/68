                    In 1964, Walt Disney began to secretly buy millions of dollar’s worth of central Florida (History). Also known as “D” Day for Orlando, Walt announced that he planned to build a spectacular theme park. Micky Mouse was one of the characters that got to escort some of the first visitors into the magic Kingdom. Numerous people including celebrities took part in the celebrations (History). Disney World has the incredible ability to turn every vacation into a once in a life time experience (Don). The attention in detail that Walt put into the park makes it seem almost magical to many. An example of the details of Disney World would be their rides. Many parks rides can feature a ton of steel, pipes, and fences (Albert). Disney makes their rides have a good theme along the way and one can hardly see any sight of backstage stairs up the roller coaster or fences around the ride (Albert). Everywhere someone would look not only on the rides there will be pleasing to the eye, funny or fits in with the theme of the land (Albert).</P>

                <p>Sonic the Hedgehog[b] is a 2020 live action/computer-animated action-adventure comedy film based on the Sonic the Hedgehog video game franchise published by Sega. Directed by Jeff Fowler (in his feature directorial debut) and written by Pat Casey and Josh Miller, it stars Ben Schwartz and Jim Carrey, with James Marsden and Tika Sumpter also in starring roles. It is the first installment in a planned Sonic the Hedgehog film series. The film follows Sonic the Hedgehog (voiced by Schwartz), who teams up with local town sheriff Tom Wachowski (Marsden) to find his lost rings and escape the mad scientist Dr. Robotnik (Carrey).

                    Development for a Sonic film began in the 1990s, but did not leave the planning stage until Sony Pictures acquired the rights in 2013. Production involved the collaboration of Sega Sammy's Japanese studio Marza Animation Planet, with Fowler brought in to direct in 2016. After Sony put the project in turnaround, Paramount Pictures acquired it in 2017. The majority of the cast signed on by August 2018, and principal filming took place between September and October that year in Vancouver and on Vancouver Island. Following the negative reaction to the first trailer in 2019, the film's release was delayed by three months to redesign Sonic himself.</p>
